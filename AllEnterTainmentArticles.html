                                Mumbai: A lot has changed in the music industry today, believes noted composer Salim
                                Merchant, as budding musicians have several social media applications at their disposal
                                to showcase their work. </p>
                                <p>Gone are the days when singers had to depend on music directors in the movies and
                                    record labels to churn out songs, said Salim Merchant, one-half of the music
                                    director duo Salim-Sulaiman.</p>
                                <p>“Previously, we had to go through the labels and films were the only medium. But now,
                                    there is independent music. You can release your music on YouTube, Facebook, and
                                    Instagram. You can do an original song or a cover. So, there are many ways for an
                                    artist to be discovered today,” the 49-year-old musician told PTI in an interview.
                                </p>
                                <p>Salim Merchant, also a singer known for hits such as "Ali Maula" and "Ainvayi
                                    Ainvayi", said
                                    while he is someone who keeps up with the times, he doesn't believe in blindly
                                    following them.</p>

                                <p>"I am open to all the new trends, in fact swaying with it. It's good to accept the
                                    change... So, don’t want to just go by the trends but create trends too.</p>
                                <p>"When you want to create trends, you should also have the ability to accept new
                                    trends... I have my own music label (Merchant Records), I am doing concerts and
                                    producing a lot of new content for TV, and YouTube," added the music director, whose
                                    career spans over three decades in the industry.</p>
                                <p>For him, music transcends all barriers. "In my band, everybody is 15-20 years younger
                                    to me. When we perform live, sometimes the college audience that we play for is 20
                                    years younger, but we go by the fact that music has no language, no age barrier,” he
                                    said.</p>
                                <p>Salim Merchant, along with his music partner and brother Sulaiman Merchant, is
                                    looking forward to the premiere of their musical “Disco Dancer: The Musical”.</p>
                                <p>The stage production is adapted from the 1982 hit film "Disco Dancer", directed by
                                    Babbar Subhash and headlined by Mithun Chakraborty.</p> <br>
                                <p>“Disco Dancer: The Musical” will feature the late Bappi Lahiri’s chartbuster tracks
                                    in a re-imagined score by Salim-Sulaiman.</p>

                                <p>The musical is described as a celebration of Bollywood, bringing back the grandeur of
                                    the ’80s, unforgettable songs, disco-style dancing, and memorable dialogues for
                                    audiences of all generations in India. </p>
                                <p>Salim Merchant said he had discussed the idea of the musical with the veteran music
                                    composer, who was thrilled about the venture.</p>
                                <p>Lahiri, who popularised disco music in India in the '80s and '90s, died in February
                                    2022 following multiple health issues at the age of 69.</p>
                                <p>“He (Lahiri) was very happy and excited about it. It’s unfortunate that he’s no more.
                                    It was my dream for him to attend the premiere (of the musical),” he added.</p>
                                <p>The Mumbai-born composer recalled performing Lahiri's hit song "Koi Yahan Nache
                                    Nache" from "Disco Dancer" during his school days.</p>
                                <p>“One of my fondest memories from when I was 12-13 years is, I was making and learning
                                    music, playing sports, studying and watching movies such as 'Disco Dancer' two-three
                                    times,” said Salim Merchant.</p>
                                <p>"Disco Dancer: The Musical" is being brought to India by Saregama and Hindi film star
                                    Suniel Shetty after sold-out shows at the UK’s West End last November. It will
                                    premiere on April 14 at Mumbai's NSCI dome.</p>

                                <p>Hyderabad: Nani and Keerthy Suresh starrer Dasara is doing well at the box office.
                                    Srikanth Odela's directorial is said to be entering the Rs 100 crore club at the box
                                    office. It is one of the very few films made against the backdrop of Telangana. As
                                    the film has become a hit for various reasons, let us talk to Nani about the making
                                    of Dasara and several other aspects of visual beauty. Excerpts: </p>
                                <p><b>NM:</b> Hi, Nani. Congratulations on the success of Dasara.<br></p>
                                <p><b>Nani: </b>Thank you so much. Feels nice to be talking about the film post-release
                                    and its success.</p>
                                <p><b>NM</b>: People are comparing Dasara and your performance to Ram Charan in
                                    Rangasthalam and Allu Arjun in Pushpa. It made its way to the list of cult films in
                                    Telugu cinema. How do you feel? </p>
                                <p><b>Nani:</b> I feel delighted. Thanks to the audiences for their comparison. If the
                                    film and my performance have made such an impact on them, I am really glad about it.
                                    Both Rangasthalam and Pushpa are two of the many all-time blockbusters of the
                                    industry. Ram Charan and Allu Arjun have delivered their best for those films and if
                                    the audiences believe I have given my best to Dasara, what else do I need?<br></p>
                                <p><b>NM</b>: You have compared Dasara to RRR. You were always confident about your
                                    success and people got offended by that. What do you have to say about it?<br></p>
                                <p><b>Nani</b>: Only after watching the film, people realized why I was always confident
                                    about Dasara's success. As you said, many people thought I was overconfident. I even
                                    went through a few articles which were written to roast me for my confidence. But
                                    now the same people are praising me for my performance and understood the reason
                                    behind my confidence.<br></p>
                                <p><b>NM</b>: You have introduced 10 new directors to the industry. You are still doing
                                    it. Don't you feel like you need to play a safe game now?<br></p>
                                <p><b>Nani</b>: I have no godfather here. I struggled hard to reach where I am today.
                                    Somebody should give chance to newcomers, right? And a safe game is not my cup of
                                    tea anymore. I go ahead and do the film if I like the story. I will be taking the
                                    risk</p>
                                <p><b>NM</b>: Were you convinced that Keerthy Suresh could play Vennela?<br></p>
                                <p><b>Nani</b>: I was always sure that Keerthy could pull off the role of Vennela. I was
                                    the one who asked Srikanth to narrate the story to Keerthy. He had someone else in
                                    mind and when he went to give the narration he was praying to god and wished that
                                    Keerthy should say no. The day she was on the sets, and when he asked her to do
                                    certain things as a part of the test look, she just nailed it.<br></p>
                                <p><b>NM</b>: Now that Telugu films are going global, and you are a producer as well, do
                                    you think it is high time to invest in the content and not the face value of the
                                    lead actor?<br></p>
                                <p><b>Nani</b>: Some stories, which need to be told to audiences, definitely need a face
                                    that can be easily recognized. If Netflix is making a movie and can spend hundreds
                                    of crores on it, they are okay with it because it will be there on their app and
                                    nobody can ask them to remove it. But for theatrical releases, the game is
                                    different. Producer needs a face that will make the audiences come to the theaters,
                                    and also add weightage to the story. So yes, it is time to invest in the content and
                                    of course, make sure the lead actors are chosen well.</p>

                                <p>Hyderabad: The Bathukamma song from ‘Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan’ has taken the
                                    internet by storm. Starring Salman Khan, Pooja Hegde, and Venkatesh, the film is
                                    slated for release on 21 April, on the occasion of Eid.</p>
                                <p>After the Bathukamma song went viral, the makers released another song from the film
                                    and again, it has some Telugu verses that make the song special.</p>
                               
                                <p>‘RRR’ star Ram Charan appears glowing and energetic in this euphoric song that also
                                    features Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, Victory Venkatesh, and Pooja Hegde. The
                                    Mega Power Star makes a stylish entry in a shimmering yellow shirt and white lungi.
                                    He shakes a leg with his real-life friend Salman and Tollywood star Venkatesh. The
                                    choreography adds to the charm of the dance moves of the ‘RRR’ star, whose ease and
                                    style quotient are graceful.</p>
                                <p>The lead actors dance wearing lungis and their moves are making fans go gaga.
                                    Watching Salman ace the south Indian avatar and reciting dialogues is worth
                                    watching.</p>
                                <p>When the film hits the screens this Eid, the ‘Game Changer’ actor’s fans will surely
                                    be in for a treat. The song is composed by Payal Dev.</p>
                                <p>Also, it is quite clear that the Bollywood stars are trying to make the best of their
                                    southern stars and their rapport with them. Salman Khan was seen playing an extended
                                    cameo in Chiranjeevi’s ‘Godfather’ and now, he has returned the favour with Charan’s
                                    cameo in this song.</p>
